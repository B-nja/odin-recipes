    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Flan is a rich, creamy and sweet baked custard dessert covered with the most amazing and flavorful golden caramel sauce. This impressive but easy flan recipe is made with only five ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole Milk</li>
        <li>Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step by Step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, it is important to know that flan should be made a day before you are planning on serving it. The delicate custard needs some time to chill and set. Plan for about 5 hours of cooling/setting time. In my opinion, this is the hardest part of making flan! Waiting to eat it.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat combine 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water. As the mixture heats up, the sugar dissolves the mixture becomes a light golden brown, just like the color of honey. Swirl the pan occasionally to heat sugar evenly. It is important to keep an eye on the mixture as sugar can burn very fast. It can go from beautiful golden brown to dark caramel and burnt caramel pretty quickly. Remove it from the heat as soon as it is golden in color.</li>
        <li>Carefully, as the mixture will be hot, pour the caramel into the baking pan swirling the pan to coat the bottom evenly. Work fast as this mixture hardens quickly. If it does, just warm it up over low heat. Set aside. The caramel will harden, that is expected.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs, sweetened condensed milk, whole milk and vanilla extract. Do not whisk too vigorously, this prevents too many air bubbles from forming</li>
        <li>Pour custard into the caramel coated pan and cover it (I use aluminum foil) then place this pan into a larger pan and fill it halfway up with warm water. Bake.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking pan from the oven and using a kitchen towel or oven mitt carefully lift the flan pan. Remove the cover (lid or aluminum foil) and allow it to cool for about an hour.When the flan is cooled, cover the pan and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Slide a paring knife around the edges of the pan to loosen up the flan. Invert a serving platter on top of flan pan and turn the pan and platter over. When flan is released, carefully lift off the flan pan. The caramel should be at the bottom of the serving platter.</li>
